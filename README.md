# Hot Pocolate
#### TACTILE ENTERTAINABLE ADORNMENT

HOT POCOLATE is an application built for monster collecting cop-locked .gifs and blending them into a silk-seizure anxiety-maize.

How to play: Before playing HOT POCOLATE, queue up some music and get in a comfortable position. Hold the the left Joycon like a TV remote and hit any button on beat with the music. After becoming entranced, the background will sync up with the music that is playing.

### Features:
  - Binary versions of HOT POCOLATE contain over 100!! (wow!) unique .gifs to scroll through at your leisure.
  - Two semi-secret chief executive officer battles inspired by classic arcade games.

### The good stuff:
HOT POCOLATE is applicable to several unique operating systems, including:
  - A Nintendo Switch capable of running homebrew (tested and working on firmware 5.1.0)
  - A screensaver for Microsoft Windows
  - Your overpriced Mac computer

In an effort to avoid a cop-dilemma, the HOT POCOLATE source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

Troubleshooting, Nintendo Switch only: If the application refuses to boot for whatever reason, start Hot Pocolate with both Joycons attached and then remove the left Joycon when the application starts. In docked mode, I get good results by placing the Switch in sleep mode before docking.

Installation, Windows only: Run the Hot Pocolate installer and go to the folder where it was installed. Right click HotPocolate.scr and click install. It should now be able to run as a screensaver.
